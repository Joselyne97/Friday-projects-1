    <p> I'm 22 years old, I'm the second child among 3 siblings and we are 2 girls and 1 boy in our family and I have both parents.
    I was originally born and raised in Rwanda; I live in Kicukiro-Kigali city. I am dressed for business and I am a courageous girl and a hard worker, as a leader I took the initiative of teaching and training people, especially women who are not competitive to the local market, to transform the abandoned waste materials like plastic bottles, old clothes and other disposal materials into ornamental materials to be used in interior design as an environmental friendly manner. We envision a world where setting up a creative recycling company and designing projects that will be among the master mind and spear header of environmental protection will address the environmental issues we are now facing today and introduce projects that bring transformative changes in our nation and on the global scale in terms of environmental protection.
    I consider being in University of Rwanda in college of science and technology is my highest academic achievement even if I’m not yet a graduate; I’m looking forward to be among young girls who will graduate as scientist and continue to have a master’s degree even a PHD because I want use the knowledge that I will gain to my country also my continent. Most of my fellow students failed to get a job after college because all they want is what is in the field of study, so my vision is to have many different experiences that will help me to be able to comprise the most outstanding young leaders from across Africa with the potential to bring transformative change in my country and on the continent which I want to be part of building a strong company that will address environment issues and projects to leave a positive legacy for future generations by using the knowledge and skills that I will learnt in my faculty with the help of my community. I’m motivated to be a Youth Leader because I was taught how to identify, plan and evaluate what I want in my projects so that I can achieve my goal. And of course with the help of technology, I will use the knowledge and skills that will learn in <strong>Moringa school</strong> to help me! 
    Here is the projects that I have done in <strong>Moringa School</strong> but mostly are exercises, let me show you the exercises that I have made on <a href="https://github.com/Joselyne97/Wednesday-projects">Wednesday</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Joselyne97/Thursday-1">Thrusday</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/Joselyne97/First-project">Tuesday</a>.</p>
