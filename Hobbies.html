             <li>At my high school I belonged to three clubs: E.A.C. Club (East African Community Club), Scientific Club, and Red Cross Club till now, where we do some projects and trainings with the help of our teachers. For example, one of the activities we did in E.A.C club was to go to do practical activities like to go to cultivate in the farm and to study how we can develop the economics of our country. Scientific club includes experiments in the science laboratories, and experiments from natural resources, like sunlight to make soap and artificial resources. For example, we had an electrical bell and we used it in our school to ring when it is time to change classes. The school now uses that bell every day. Red Cross Club includes learning how to help people who have accidents quickly without needing a doctor.</li>
             <li>In other activities, I have participated in young leaders program as a Digital Opportunity Trust (DOT) impactathon this year 2018. We have learnt how to empower women, in ICT, environment awareness and how to make projects that bring solution to the women… </li>

We are not trying to bring about a drastic transformation overnight. Rather, we are sowing the seeds today that will encourage people to be more inclined towards liberty so it leads to more meaningful and long-lasting transformations in years to come. We are empowering students to take meaningful actions today that will bring about a freer future. </li>
